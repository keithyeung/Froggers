# Froggers
Froggers Clone

A project I created with SFML. In this project, other than normal game logic for froggers, I learnt how to create animations with frame. When the frog moves, there's six 2D image for the frog's animation.
One thing very important is I DO NOT own all the copyright for the art, I downloaded everything because what I'm focusing is the game mechanics and game logic.
